# WARNING

The algorithm implementation is not yet finished,
and will currently produce no output.
This warning will be removed when implementation is finished.

# wavefront-voronoi-ND

This is an extension of work on wavefront voronoi in 2D space as exemplified in
wevo (https://github.com/cgalab/wevo.git).
By abstracting wave intersections,
the wavefront algorithm can be extended to ND space for use in high-dimensional
applications such as materials science and machine learning.

# Dependencies

The basic algorithm runs purely on python standard libraries.
The visualization code (vis.py) depends on the ```Panda3d``` library
for 3d rendering (https://www.panda3d.org).
Install this dependency using ```pip```:

```pip install panda3d```

# Love you!
